# Project Title

Project Catwalk

## Overview

* Our client-facing retail web-portal has become significantly outdated and has been proven to be hurting sales numbers.   Project Catwalk comprises a complete redesign of the retail portal designed to address this concern and modernize the site.

* The initial release will focus on providing the minimum viable product for our retail application. Features implemented will be constrained to the client experience which enables customers to search, browse, add to cart, and checkout. Maintenance of the catalog and internal systems are not in scope for this project. Improvements other than those to the client user interface are out of scope for this project.

## Description

* Our new site allows a visitor to view the following sections:

1. A main product detail page.
This section, most prominent on the screen, allows the visitor to scroll through photo galleries of the product, see available sizes and styles, and read detailed information about the product. The visitor can click on a button to add the item to a shopping cart, or click on another button to add it to a saved outfit, described in the section below.

2. Scrolling views of other catalog items related to the main page product and outfits chosen by the visitor.
These sections, immediately below the main product detail, show abbreviated card-size descriptions of catalog prodcuts. By clicking on the cards of one of the related items, the visitor renders it as the new item displayed on the main page. When the visitor clicks on a comparison button on one of the related items, a new window opens showing a table that compares characteristics of the main product with the related product.

3. An area where the visitor can ask and find answers to common questions about the main page product.
This section contains a search box for the visitor to query the database of questions. As the visitor types, the field of questions and answers below the box displays the matieral matching the keywords of the visitor's question. The vistor can also click a button to open a new window, allowing the visitor to submit a new question, along with their name and contact information.

4. An area where the visitor can read ratings and reviews of the main page product, or write their own ratings and reviews.
This section initializes with a short list of reviews, associated with the main page product, and written by other customers. The user can click on a button to open a new window, allowing them to recommend, review, and rate the product on a variety of metrics. Once submitted, the visitor's review becomes part of the growing database of reviews.
